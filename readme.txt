### Cryptocurrency Payment Gateway Plugin for MemberPress by CryptoPay

First of all, we would like to point out that this plugin is not a standalone plugin. This plugin is a **<a href="https://beycanpress.com/cryptopay/?utm_source=wporg_readme&utm_medium=cryptopay_memberpress">cryptocurrency payment gateway for MemberPress</a>**. In other words, users who want to sell memberships with cryptocurrency payments can use WordPress and MemberPress. However, this plugin is a plugin for CryptoPay and a cryptocurrency payment gateway for MemberPress. So it's actually CryptoPay, which is the main plugin that handles cryptocurrency payments for WordPress. Therefore, users must have both plugins.

Thanks to this plugin, you can receive **<a href="https://beycanpress.com/cryptopay/?utm_source=wporg_readme&utm_medium=cryptopay_memberpress">cryptocurrency payments</a>** from many Blockchain networks, especially Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and sell paid memberships with cryptocurrencies on your WordPress site with the MemberPress plugin.
