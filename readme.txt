== Description ==

First of all, we would like to point out that this plugin is not a plugin on its own. This plugin is a payment gateway for MemberPress. In other words, with MemberPress, users who want to sell memberships with cryptocurrency payments through WordPress can use it. But this plugin is a plugin for CryptoPay and a cryptocurrency payment gateway for MemberPress. So the payment is actually CryptoPay, the main plugin that manages the cryptocurrency payment process. Therefore, users must have both plugins.

Thanks to this plugin, you can receive crypto money payments from many Blockchain networks, especially Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, with the MemberPress plugin on your WordPress site, and you can sell paid memberships with crypto coins.
